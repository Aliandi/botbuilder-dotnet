# LuisDispatchBot hosted in ASP.NET Core

This bot demonstrates how to use a LUIS app generated by the Dispatch tool. 

See https://aka.ms/bot-dispatch for more information on the Dispatch tool.

To run this sample:
1) Make sure you have the Bot Framework Emulator and tools installed.
2) cd scripts
3) npm start
4) This will setup services so you can run this sample and interact with it using the emulator.

This example assumes the LUIS app from Dispatch is generated from two LUIS apps and one QnAMaker service:
 * A LUIS app named "homeautomation", for handling messages about turning lights and appliances on and off
 * A LUIS app named "weather", for handling requests for weather forecasts and conditions
 * A QnA Maker service named "faq", for answering questions about using the hypothetical home automation system.

The tool creates a LUIS app with one intent for each of the constituent LUIS apps and QnAMaker services: 
"l_homeautomation", "l_weather", "q_faq".
The bot uses the intents to route the user messages to the appropriate LUIS app or QnA Maker.

Dispatching the messages to the original LUIS apps allows the bot to get entities from the these apps. 
The LUIS app generated by the Dispatch tool doesn't contain entity information.
